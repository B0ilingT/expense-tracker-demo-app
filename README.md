# Expense Tracker
This was created as part of a course to learn flutter and dart

### Adding Expenses:
You can use this app to track expenses, adding with the + button in the top right as shown in the below images.
After adding an image it will display on the graph and be added to the list of expenses on the home screen.

### Removing Expenses: 
To remove an expense you can swipe on the expense card to remove it.

### Other Features:
The expenses are stored using flutter-secure-storage and are persistent so you can close the app without losing your expenses.
